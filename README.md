## 💡 How It Works

1. Users can search for products (e.g., “Laptop”, “Smartphone”).
2. The app dynamically fetches product data from a pre-defined local database in `script.js`.
3. Products are displayed with prices from multiple e-commerce sites.
4. The lowest price is automatically marked with a **“Best Price”** badge.
5. Users can also view items in a **shopping cart sidebar**.
